edison-web
==========

This web application was created as a project for a course during my studies. 
It's main purpouse was to demonstrate my knowledge of Java programming language and its fundamentals.

I had fun creating it because it mocks university information system Edison.

This application was developed using Java technologies such as JSP, JSTL and JDBC.
